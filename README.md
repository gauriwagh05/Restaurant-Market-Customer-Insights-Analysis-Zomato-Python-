# Restaurant-Market-Customer-Insights-Analysis-Zomato-Python-
This project focuses on analyzing restaurant data from Zomato to derive actionable market and customer insights. Using Python, the project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to understand restaurant distribution, popular cuisines, customer preferences, cost patterns, and ratings trends across cities.
Cleaned and preprocessed 12,000+ restaurant records
Analyzed customer ratings across cuisines
Identified top 10 cuisines by average rating (Italian, Continental, South Indian, etc.)
Visualized trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn
Observed that higher cost does not guarantee higher rating.
